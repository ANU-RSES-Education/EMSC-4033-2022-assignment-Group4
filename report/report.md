# Group Report

We created this repository via a series of individual and collaborative tasks highlighted in this report. 

# Pull requests

We edited our files on individual branches made coming off the main branch. With updates to our work, we committed these changes to the github repository using the terminal, specifically using the 'git add', 'git commit -m' and 'git push' commands. For 'git push', the password required is our personal access tokens which can be created in the settings page of a user's github profile. After pushing these changes to github, we created pull requests of our branch into the main branch. These included a title/comment message that detailed the nature of the update.  

# Pull request reviews

Following from creating pull requests, these were reviewed by another member of the group before merging it into the main branch. Another group member was able to review the changes to another's code or markdown file and comment positive feedback and/or any thoughts and suggestions. 

# Collaborative editing of documents

The README.md and this report.md file were created collaboratively. We designated different sections of the collaborative documents for each member to work on after discussing what was required. We wrote on individual branches and created pull requests to merge and review each others writing. We also created and resolved issues in this process to aid each other in creating these files. 

# Creating and resolving issues

Issues were raised to consult other members on an issue or comment/review on another member's work without updating the files as a pull request does. 

# Adding tests

Tests were written for our individual my_functions.py files in test_function.py files within each of our named folders. These tests were written using the pytest framework and tested on RunTests.ipynb notebooks, also found in our individual folders on the repository.

# Adding documentation/docstrings

Documentation and docstrings were utilised in individual my_functions.py and test_function.py files. The docstrings aim to help explain what each function does. The documentation aims to supplement the code so that a user/viewer is able to understand more nuanced parts of the MapMaker file, for example.
