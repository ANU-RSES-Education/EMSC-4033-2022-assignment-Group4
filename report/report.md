*From instructions file:*

We would further like you to document how you all collaborated with a short markdown report 
that, again, is developed collaboratively. Each of you should contribute to it via pull requests, etc.
Please use this report as an opportunity to highlight the aspects of the marking rubric that we
are going to be evaluating for the group.

We expect you to manage this task through GitHub pull requests. We would like to see each of
you make one or more pull requests, review somebody else's pull request, raise issue(s) and 
check that they can be closed, etc.
